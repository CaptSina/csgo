-----------------

The following is my custom configuration for Counter Strike Global Offensive. Feel free to tweak these settings to your liking. 

Installation:

1. The autoexec.cfg and config.cfg files will need to be uploaded to the following location on your local drive: 

\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg

Make sure to create a backup of your current config.cfg file, you can simply rename it to config.old 

2. Launch game and open the developer console by hitting the ~ button 

3. Input the following command: 

exec autoexec.cfg

4. Restart game, make modifications to options and autoexec.cfg as you like.

**Introduction:**


The following is my custom configuration for Counter Strike Global Offensive, I have spent a considerable amount of time researching and compiling what I have found to be the best settings. View this autoexec as a good "frame work" and build upon it, feel free to tweak these settings to your liking.

**Installation:**
<br />

<ol>
<li>The autoexec.cfg and config.cfg files will need to be uploaded to the following location on your local drive: 
<br />
\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
<br />The hud files within the "flash" folder are located at the following location on your local drive, they will need to be uploaded to the following location:
<br /> 
Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource\flash

</li>

<br />
<li>Launch game and open the developer console by hitting the ~ button </li>
<br />
<li>Input the following command: exec autoexec.cfg </li>
<br />
<li>Restart game, make modifications to options and autoexec.cfg as you like. </li>
<br />
</ol>

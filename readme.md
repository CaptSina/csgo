### Introduction ###

---

The following is my custom configuration for Counter Strike Global Offensive, having spent a considerable amount of time researching and compiling what I have found to be a solid foundation for a autoexec.  I typically update this configuration configuration weekly, so check back for the latest. 



View this autoexec as a good "frame work" and build upon it, feel free to tweak these settings to your liking, and be sure to contact me with any issues or bugs. 

The video.txt file is optimized for the highest fps performance and viability, feel free to modify it to your personal preferences.

### Notes ###

---

**Rates:**

Rates are configured for 128 tickrate servers however will scale down for lower tickrate. 
<br />

**Raw Input and Mouse Acceleration:**

Based on my research and first-hand experience, the in game rawinput 'm_rawinput 0' has been disabled. You can read more about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1f8km4/csgo_raw_input_faulty/), I recommend you set up the [The MarkC Windows 8 + 7 Mouse Acceleration Fix](http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html) to get a true 1:1 pointer response. 

**Crosshair Customization:**

This configuration comes with 9 pre-built crosshair binds, you can toggle between them in game using your numpad #1 - #9.
